[HWInfo64]https://www.hwinfo.com/ was used instead of data from Lab 7 to monitor CPU Usage and Temperature.

- HWInfo is extremely useful for monitoring components of your computer such as CPU, Memory, GPU, Storage, etc. Information can be logged to a CSV file which is what I used for this lab. Settings were adjusted to only log the Overall CPU usage and Core Temperatures. Alternatively this program could be used to monitor and log information on a per core basis.

- Logging was started with multiple chrome windows open, VS Codem Spotify and other various programs running.

- Cinebench R20 was downloaded installed and run while logging. (CPU Benchmark Software)

Cinebench R20 benchmark was run with other programs kept open which likely affected score. Laptop was plugged in and set to performance mode for duration of test and logging.

- Logging stopped after test run complete. score: 1857
- CPU: i7-8750H (Dell XPS 15 9570)
